grep 'search_term' file.txt
the -E flag for regular expressions without surrounding the search term
case-insensitive, you can use the -i flag:

man grep
grep  searches  for  PATTERNS in each FILE.  PATTERNS is one or more patterns separated by newline characters, and grep prints each line that matches a pattern.  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted when
       grep is used in a shell command.


-i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so that characters that differ only in case match each other.
 -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret PATTERNS as extended regular expressions
-c, --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.  With the -v, --invert-match option (see above), count non-matching lines.
-L, --files-without-match
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which no output would normally have been printed.
-l, --files-with-matches  
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which output would normally have been printed.  Scanning each input file stops upon first match.
f FILE, --file=FILE
              Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  If this option is used multiple times or is combined with the -e (--regexp) option, search  for  all  patterns  given.   The  empty  file  contains  zero
              patterns, and therefore matches nothing.  If FILE is - , read patterns from standard input.
