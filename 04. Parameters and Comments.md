## Parameters 

A parameter is an entity that stores values. It can be a name, a number, or one of the special characters (listed in the link at the bottom.) 
A variable is a parameter denoted by a name. 
A variable has a value and zero or more attributes. 
Attributes are assigned using the declare builtin command (listed in the link at the bottom.) 

A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value. The null string is a valid value. Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the unset builtin command.

#### Variable Types
    Although Bash is not a typed language, it does have a few different types of variables. These types define the kind of content they are allowed to have. Type information       is stored internally by Bash.
    Array: declare -a variable: The variable is an array of strings.
    Associative array: declare -A variable: The variable is an associative array of strings (bash 4.0 or higher).
    Integer: declare -i variable: The variable holds an integer. Assigning values to this variable automatically triggers Arithmetic Evaluation.
    Read Only: declare -r variable: The variable can no longer be modified or unset.
    Export: declare -x variable: The variable is marked for export which means it will be inherited by any child process.

#### Defining variables (variable=value).
    In bash, variables are defined without any spaces around the equal sign (=). Here's the basic syntax:
    variable_name=value

#### Accessing variables ($variable).
    To access the value of a variable, prefix the variable name with a dollar sign ($):
    echo $variable_name

Example of Defining and Accessing Variables
    #!/bin/bash
    
#### Define variables
    greeting="Hello"
    name="World"
    year=$(date +%Y) # Command substitution to get the current year

#### Access variables
    echo "$greeting, $name!"  # Output: Hello, World!
    echo "The current year is $year."  # Output: The current year is 2024.

EXAMPLE 2 
The purpose of the script is to collect and save the content of various user-specific configuration and history files from a Linux system for users with a UID greater than or equal to 1000. 

#!/bin/bash

# Get a list of users with UID equal to or greater than 1000. This generally includes all regular users on the system, excluding system and service accounts.
users=$(getent passwd | awk -F: '$3 >= 1000 && $1 != "nobody" { print $1 }')

# For each identified user, the script:
# Checks if the user's home directory exists.
# Attempts to read the content of several important files located in the user's home directory, including:
# .bash_history: Contains the user's command history for Bash shell sessions.
# .bash_logout: Contains commands that are executed when the user logs out of a Bash session.
# .bashrc: Contains commands that are executed when a new Bash session is started.
# .profile: Contains initialization commands for the user’s shell.
# .python_history: Contains Python interactive shell history.
# .zsh_history: Contains the user’s command history for Zsh shell sessions (if using Zsh).
# .zshrc: Contains commands executed for each new Zsh shell session (if using Zsh).

for user in $users
do
    # Read user-specific files and handle any potential errors
    GetBashHistory=$(cat "/home/$user/.bash_history" 2>/dev/null)
    GetBashLog=$(cat "/home/$user/.bash_logout" 2>/dev/null)
    GetBashRc=$(cat "/home/$user/.bashrc" 2>/dev/null)
    GetProfile=$(cat "/home/$user/.profile" 2>/dev/null)
    GetPythonHistory=$(cat "/home/$user/.python_history" 2>/dev/null)
    GetZshHistory=$(cat "/home/$user/.zsh_history" 2>/dev/null)
    Getzshrc=$(cat "/home/$user/.zshrc" 2>/dev/null)

    # Write the gathered information to a file
    {
        echo "Bash History:"
        echo "$GetBashHistory"
        echo
        echo "Bash Logout:"
        echo "$GetBashLog"
        echo
        echo "Bash RC:"
        echo "$GetBashRc"
        echo
        echo "Profile:"
        echo "$GetProfile"
        echo
        echo "Python History:"
        echo "$GetPythonHistory"
        echo
        echo "Zsh History:"
        echo "$GetZshHistory"
        echo
        echo "Zsh RC:"
        echo "$Getzshrc"
    } > "$user.CommandHistory.txt"
    
    echo "Results saved to $user.CommandHistory.txt"
done

## Comments

Single-line comments are used to annotate a single line of code. In bash, you use the # symbol to start a single-line comment.
# This is a single-line comment

Example
#!/bin/bash
# Define a variable
name="Alice"  # This variable holds the user's name

Multi-line comments using : <<'END' and END.
Another way to simulate multi-line comments is by using a here document with : ' ... ' or << 'COMMENT' ... COMMENT. This approach is not a true comment but effectively ignores the enclosed text.

EXAMPLE
    : '
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It can span multiple lines.
    '
OR
    #!/bin/bash
    << 'COMMENT'
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It will not be executed or printed.
    COMMENT

    # Print a greeting
    echo "Hello, World!"

This works even though shell scripts do not have a built-in multi-line comment syntax like some other programming languages.
    : << 'COMMENTED_OUT':
    : is called a no operation (no-op) command in the shell, which effectively does nothing and always returns a successful exit status.
    << is a "Here Document" (often abbreviated as "heredoc") operator that redirects a block of text to the input of a command.
    'COMMENTED_OUT' is a delimiter that marks the beginning and the end of the heredoc. Everything between : << 'COMMENTED_OUT' and COMMENTED_OUT is treated as input to the      : command.

This is because of the heredoc syntax (Not to be confused with a single < which is an input redirect, which is used to take input from a file. The heredoc  << 'DELIMITER' allows you to specify a custom delimiter string, and everything between this opening delimiter and the matching closing delimiter on a line by itself is treated as input.

The delimiters 'COMMENTED_OUT' are purely arbitrary and are there for readability and convenience. They can be replaced with any other string, ei - 'IGNORE', 'SKIP', or anything else that makes sense in the context of your script…. Again only requirement is that the opening and closing delimiters match.

So simply for multi line comments:
The colon (:) or No-Op ignores anything  is forwarded it from the << ‘heredoc’ - that sits between the  chosen delimiters.
