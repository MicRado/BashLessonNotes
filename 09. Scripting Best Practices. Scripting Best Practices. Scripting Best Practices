Error Handling:
Using exit codes and trap for catching errors.
Debugging:
Using set -x for debugging scripts.
Script Optimization:
Tips for writing efficient and maintainable scripts

Always Use Double Quotes: Double-quote variables to prevent word splitting and globbing.
FILE="my file.txt"
echo "$FILE"

Use Meaningful Variable Names: Choose clear and descriptive names for variables to make your script easier to understand.
user_name="JohnDoe"

Check for Errors: Use set -e to exit the script when a command fails, and set -u to treat unset variables as an error.
set -e
set -u

Use Functions: Break your script into functions to make it modular and reusable.
greet_user() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}
greet_user "Alice"

Use $(...) for Command Substitution: Itâ€™s more readable and nestable than backticks.
current_date=$(date)

Avoid Using eval: It can be dangerous and lead to security vulnerabilities.
Use ShellCheck: This is a static analysis tool that helps you find bugs in your scripts.
shellcheck myscript.sh

Sanitize Inputs: Always validate and sanitize inputs to avoid security issues.
if [[ "$input" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Valid input"
else
    echo "Invalid input"
fi

Use printf Instead of echo: printf is more powerful and consistent.
printf "Hello, %s!\n" "$user_name"

Comment Your Code: Add comments to explain complex parts of your script.
# This function greets the user
greet_user() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}
