## man
an interface to the system reference manuals

##### DESCRIPTION
man is the system's manual pager. Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function. The manual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed. A section, if provided, will  direct  man to look only in that section of the manual. The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections

##### EXAMPLES
```dork
man ls
```
> Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

## mkdir 
make directories

##### SYNOPSIS
       mkdir [OPTION]... DIRECTORY...
##### DESCRIPTION
       Create the DIRECTORY(ies), if they do not already exist.
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
       -m, --mode=MODE
              set file mode (as in chmod), not a=rwx - umask

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
## grep
grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep - print lines that match patterns

##### SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTION...] PATTERNS [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -e PATTERNS ... [FILE...]
       grep [OPTION...] -f PATTERN_FILE ... [FILE...]
##### DESCRIPTION
       grep searches for PATTERNS in each FILE.  PATTERNS is one or more patterns separated by newline characters, and grep prints each line that matches a pattern.                  Typically PATTERNS should be quoted when grep is used in a shell command.

       A FILE of “-” stands for standard input.  If no FILE is given, recursive searches examine the working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.
Matching Control
       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data, so that characters that differ only in case match each other.
General Output Control
       -c, --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.  With the -v, --invert-match option (see above), count non-matching lines.
Output Line Prefix Control
       -n, --line-number
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.

## read
In bash is used to read input from the user or from a file

##### SYNOPSIS
       read [OPTION]...
OPTOINS
       -a array: Read the input into an array. 
       echo "Enter some values (space-separated):"
       read -a values
       echo "You entered: ${values[@]}"
-d delim: Use delim as the delimiter instead of a newline.
       echo "Enter some text (end with 'x'):"
       read -d 'x' input
       echo "You entered: $input"
-e: Use the readline library to read the input, which allows for editing the input line.
       read -e -p "Enter your name: " name
       echo "Hello, $name"
-n nchars: Read only nchars characters, returning after nchars characters have been read.
       read -n 1 -p "Press any key to continue..."
       echo
-p prompt: Display a prompt before reading the input.
       read -p "Enter your age: " age
       echo "You are $age years old."
-s: Do not echo input (useful for passwords).
       read -s -p "Enter your password: " password
       echo
       echo "Password entered."
-t timeout: Timeout and return after timeout seconds.
       if read -t 5 -p "Enter your name within 5 seconds: " name; then
           echo "Hello, $name"
       else
           echo "Timed out!"
       fi
-u fd: Read from file descriptor fd instead of standard input.
       exec 3< inputfile
       read -u 3 line
       echo "Read from file: $line"

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
## plocate
find files by name, quickly

##### SYNOPSIS
       plocate [OPTION]...  PATTERN...
##### DESCRIPTION
       plocate finds all files on the system matching the given pattern (or all of the patterns if multiple are given). It does this by means of an index made by updatedb(8)         or (less commonly) converted from another index by plocate-build(8).

       plocate  is  largely  argument-compatible  with  mlocate(1), but is significantly faster. In particular, it rarely needs to scan through its entire database, unless           the pattern is very short (less than three bytes) or you want to search for a regular expression. It does not try to maintain compatibility with BSD locate, or                non-UTF-8 filenames and locales. Most I/O is done asynchronously, but the results are synchronized so that output comes in the same order every time.
OPTIONS
       -A, --all
              Ignored for compatibility with mlocate(1).
       -b, --basename
              Match only against the file name portion of the path name, ie., the directory names will be excluded from the match (but still printed). This does not speed up the search, but can suppress uninteresting matches.
       -c, --count
              Do not print each match. Instead, count them, and print out a total number at the end.
       -d, --database DBPATH
              Find matches in the given database, instead of /var/lib/plocate/plocate.db.  This argument can be given multiple times, to search multiple databases.  It is also possible to give multiple databases in one argument, separated by :.  (Any character, including : and \, can be escaped by prepending a \.)
       -e, --existing
              Print only entries that refer to files existing at the time locate is run. Note that unlike mlocate(1), symlinks are not followed by default (and indeed, there is no option to change this).
       -i, --ignore-case
              Do a case-insensitive match as given by the current locale (default is case-sensitive, byte-by-byte match). Note that plocate does not support the full range of Unicode case folding rules; in particular, searching for ß will not give you matches on ss even in a German locale. Also note that this option will be somewhat                slower than a case-sensitive match, since it needs to generate more candidates for searching the index.
       -N, --literal
              Print entry names without quoting. Normally, plocate will escape special characters in filenames, so that they are safe for consumption by typical shells (similar to the GNU coreutils shell-escape-always quoting style), unless printing to a pipe, but this options will turn off such quoting.

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
## less
opposite of more

##### SYNOPSIS
       less -?
       less -V
       less --version
       less [-[+]aABcCdeEfFgGiIJKLmMnNqQrRsSuUVwWX~]
            [-b space] [-h lines] [-j line] [-k keyfile]
            [-{oO} logfile] [-p pattern] [-P prompt] [-t tag]
            [-T tagsfile] [-x tab,...] [-y lines] [-[z] lines]
            [-# shift] [+[+]cmd] [--] [filename]...
       (See the OPTIONS section for alternate option syntax with long option names.)
##### DESCRIPTION
       Less  is a program similar to more(1), but which allows backward movement in the file as well as forward movement.  Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi(1).  Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on a         variety of terminals.  There is even limited support for hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed at
       the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)
OPTIONS
       -f or --force
       Forces non-regular files to be opened.  (A non-regular file is a directory or a device special file.)  Also suppresses the warning message when a binary file is opened. By default, less will refuse to open non-regular files.  Note that some operating systems will not allow directories to be read, even if -f is set.
       -n or --line-numbers
       Suppresses line numbers.  The default (to use line numbers) may cause less to run more slowly in some cases, especially with a very large input file.  Suppressing line numbers with the -n option will avoid this problem.  Using line numbers means: the line number will be displayed in the verbose prompt and in the = command, and the v         command will pass the current line number to the editor (see also the discussion of LESSEDIT in PROMPTS below).

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
## stdin
stdin, stdout, stderr - standard I/O streams

LIBRARY
       Standard C library (libc, -lc)
##### SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       extern FILE *stdin;
       extern FILE *stdout;
       extern FILE *stderr;
##### DESCRIPTION
       Under normal circumstances every UNIX program has three streams opened for it when it starts up, one for input, one for output, and one for printing diagnostic or error messages.  These are typically attached to the user's terminal (see tty(4)) but might instead refer to files or other devices, depending on what the parent              process chose to set up.  (See also the "Redirection" section of sh(1).)
       The input stream is referred to as "standard input"; the output stream is referred to as "standard output"; and the error stream is referred to as "standard error". These terms are abbreviated to form the symbols used to refer to these files, namely stdin, stdout, and stderr.
       Each of these symbols is a stdio(3) macro of type pointer to FILE, and can be used with functions like fprintf(3) or fread(3).
EXAMPLE
      stdin
      - stdin is the input stream for a program. You can read from stdin using commands like 'read' or redirection. <
      stdout
      - stdout is the output stream for a program. By default, it prints to the terminal, but you can redirect it to a file or another command. >
      stderr
      - stderr is the error output stream for a program. It's used to print error messages separately from standard output. >&2

## head
output the first part of files

##### SYNOPSIS
       head [OPTION]... [FILE]...
##### DESCRIPTION
       Print the first 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.  With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name.
       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
       -n, --lines=[-]NUM
              print the first NUM lines instead of the first 10; with the leading '-', print all but the last NUM lines of each file

## tail
output the last part of files

##### SYNOPSIS
       tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...
##### DESCRIPTION
       Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.  With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name.
       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
       -n, --lines=[+]NUM
              output the last NUM lines, instead of the last 10; or use -n +NUM to skip NUM-1 lines at the start

*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
## chmod 
change file mode bits

##### SYNOPSIS
       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...
##### DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

       Symbolic Notation: Uses letters (u, g, o, a, r, w, x) for readability.
       Octal Notation: Uses numbers (4, 2, 1, 0) for concise representation.
       Recursive Changes: Use -R to apply changes recursively.
       Special Permissions: setuid, setgid, and sticky bit for advanced permission management.

       Using Symbolic Notation
       Symbolic notation is more intuitive and human-readable. It uses u (user/owner), g (group), o (others), and a (all) to set permissions. The permissions are r (read), w (write), and x (execute).

       Using Octal Notation
       Octal notation uses numbers to represent permissions. Each digit represents different sets of permissions.

       4 = read (r)
       2 = write (w)
       1 = execute (x)
       Each permission set (user, group, others) is represented by a digit. For example, 7 (4+2+1) means read, write, and execute permissions.

       chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used.  However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line, chmod changes the permissions of the pointed-to file.  In contrast, chmod ignores           symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals
OPTIONS
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.  With --reference, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.
       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages
       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed
