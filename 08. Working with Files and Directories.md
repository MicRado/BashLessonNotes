## File Operations:

#### Reading from and Writing to Files

#### Reading from a file:
```
# Reading the content of a file and storing it in a variable
file_content=$(cat myfile.txt)
printf "Content of myfile.txt: \n"
printf "$file_content \n"
```

#### Writing to a file:
```
# Writing text to a file (overwrites existing content)
printf "This is some text." > myfile.txt
```

#### Appending text to a file
```
printf "This is additional text." >> myfile.txt
```

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
## Using Redirection and Pipes:

- (>): Redirects output to a file (overwrites existing content).

- (>>): Redirects output to a file (appends to existing content).

- (<): Redirects input from a file.
```
# Writing to a file using redirection
printf "This will overwrite the file. \n" > myfile.txt
```
```
# Appending to a file using redirection
printf "This will be added to the file. \n" >> myfile.txt
```
```
# Reading from a file using redirection
while read -r line; do
printf "Line: $line \n"
done < myfile.txt
```
#### Pipes:
|: Takes the output of one command and uses it as input to another command.
```
# Using a pipe to filter and format the output of a command
ls -l | grep "^d" | awk '{print $9}'
```

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
## Directory Operations:

#### Creating directories:   
```
# Creating a single directory
mkdir my_directory
```
#### Creating nested directories
```
mkdir -p parent_directory/child_directory
```
#### Navigating directories:
```
cd my_directory

# Going up one directory level
cd ..

# Going to the home directory
cd ~
```
#### Removing directories:
```
# Removing an empty directory
rmdir empty_directory
```
```
# Removing a directory and its contents
rm -r directory_with_contents
```

******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
## Additional Useful Commands:

#### Listing files and directories:
```
# Listing all files and directories
ls -l

# Listing all files, including hidden ones
ls -la
```

#### Copying files and directories:
```
# Copying a file
cp source_file.txt destination_file.txt

# Copying a directory and its contents
cp -r source_directory destination_directory
```

#### Moving or renaming files and directories:
```
# Moving a file
mv source_file.txt destination_directory/

# Renaming a file
mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
```

## Putting It All Together:

Here's a script that combines file and directory operations along with redirection and pipes:
```
#!/bin/bash
# Define a directory and a file
directory="example_dir"
file="example_dir/example_file.txt"

# Create the directory
mkdir -p "$directory"

# Write to the file
printf "Hello, World!" > "$file \n"

# Append to the file
printf "This is a new line." >> "$file \n"

# Read the file
printf "Content of $file: \n"
cat "$file"

# List files in the directory
printf "Listing files in $directory: \n"
ls -l "$directory"

# Filter and format the output using a pipe
printf "Files containing 'new': \n"
grep "new" "$file" | awk '{print $0}'

# Remove the directory and its contents
rm -r "$directory"

printf "Script completed. \n"
```
