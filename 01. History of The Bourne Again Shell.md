BASH is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell. It is based on the Bourne shell and is mostly compatible with its features.

Shells are command interpreters. They are applications that provide users with the ability to give commands to their operating system interactively, or to execute batches of commands quickly. In no way are they required for the execution of programs; they are merely a layer between system function calls and the user.

## Different Shell types
| Shell            | Name                       | Path             |                  
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Sh               | Bourne Shell               | /bin/sh          |
| Zsh              | Z Shell                    | /bin/zsh         |
| Ksh              | Korn Shell                 | /bin/ksh         |
| Tcsh             | Tenex C Shell              | /bin/tcsh        |
| Dash             | Debian Almquist Shell      | /bin/dash        |
| Fish             | Friendly Interactive Shell | /usr/bin/fish    |
| Csh              | C Shell                    | /bin/csh         |

Think of a shell as a way for you to speak to your system. Your system doesn't need it for most of its work, but it is an interface between you and what your system can offer. It allows you to perform basic math, run basic tests and execute applications. More importantly, it allows you to combine these operations and connect applications to each other to perform complex and automated tasks.

BASH is not your operating system. It is not your window manager. It is not your terminal (but it oftens runs inside your terminal). It does not control your mouse or keyboard. It does not configure your system, activate your screensaver, or open your files when you double-click them. It is generally not involved in launching applications from your window manager or desktop environment. It's important to understand that BASH is only an interface for you to execute statements (using BASH syntax), either at the interactive BASH prompt or via BASH scripts.


A major bash feature that is intended mostly for interactive users is job control. 
Job control gives you the ability to stop, start, and pause any number of commands at the same time. This feature was borrowed almost verbatim from the C shell.

As a command processor, Bash supports the execution of commands from files, known as shell scripts, facilitating automation.
Its syntax simplifies I/O redirection. For example, it can redirect standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) at the same time using the &> operator.

## Key points about Bash
  - Most users use Bash, since it is the default shell environment on most systems
  - Bash does not have an inline wildcard expression. A wildcard expression is when you would want to search for patterns in your Shell, similar to Regex. 
      Common wildcards include:
        *: Matches zero or more characters.
        ?: Matches exactly one character.
        [abc]: Matches any one of the enclosed characters (a, b, or c in this case).
        [a-z]: Matches any character in the specified range (a through z in this case).
  - You can't automatically change the directory name
  - (#) is treated as a comment in scripting
  - It has shopt settings
  - Prompt has backslash escapes
  - User configuration settings are in .bashrc

## Z Shell
The Z Shell, or Zsh is also a UNIX shell that is very similar to Bash. You can also script and use the shell as a command interpreter.

Zsh is an extension of the Bourne shell with a lot of improvements. Zsh was released in 1990 by Paul Falstad, and it has some features that Bash, Korn Shell, and C Shell share.
macOS by default uses the Zsh Shell.

## Key points about Zsh
  - Comes with autocompletion when using the terminal. So when you press Tab â†¹ in order to autocomplete whatever command you want to run, not only does it autocomplete for        you but will bring down a drop-down of all the other possible files and directories
  - Supports inline wildcard expressions
  - Much more configurable than Bash
  - Supports plugins and themes. Here's a list of plugins available for Zsh.
