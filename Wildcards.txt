File Name Expansion (Globbing):

Wildcards can be used to match filenames. This is known as "globbing".
Example:
# List all files ending in .txt
ls *.txt
********************************************************************
Case Statements:

Wildcards can be used in 'case' statements to match patterns.
Example:
case $variable in
    *.txt) echo "This is a text file" ;;
    *.jpg) echo "This is a JPEG image" ;;
    *) echo "Unknown file type" ;;
esac
********************************************************************
Where Wildcards Don't Work Inline
Note - "inline" refers to using wildcards directly within a single line of a command or expression, especially within conditional statements or string manipulations, rather than using a separate, more explicit structure like a case statement or an external tool.

String Comparison
When you are trying to use wildcards for inline string comparisons or within variable manipulations, Bash does not natively support this. For example:

Inline Wildcard Matching:
string="hello.txt"

if [[ "$string" == "*.txt" ]]; then
    echo "This is a text file"
else
    echo "This is not a text file"
fi
This won't work as expected because the == operator doesn't interpret the * as a wildcard.
********************************************************************
Workarounds for Inline Matching
Using case for Pattern Matching
You can use a case statement for pattern matching instead of inline conditionals:

string="hello.txt"

case "$string" in
    *.txt)
        echo "This is a text file"
        ;;
    *)
        echo "This is not a text file"
        ;;
esac
********************************************************************
Using grep or [[ ]] with Pattern Matching
You can also use grep or extended pattern matching with [[ ]] to achieve similar results:

string="hello.txt"

# Using grep
if echo "$string" | grep -q '\.txt$'; then
    echo "This is a text file"
else
    echo "This is not a text file"
fi

# Using extended pattern matching
shopt -s extglob
if [[ "$string" == *.txt ]]; then
    echo "This is a text file"
else
    echo "This is not a text file"
fi
shopt -u extglob
